## hello 👋
- 🤵 I’m `TherenceFrn`;
- 👀 I’m interested in Swift, TypeScript, Elixir and Rust;
- 🌱 I focus on backend development, specially on high-availability applications;
- 🥁 I develop random stuff - most of the times chatbots (such as [lastgram](https://github.com/musicorum-app/lastgram) - the last.fm bot for telegram) and other cool stuff (such as [ditto](https://github.com/musicorum-app/ditto), a high-speed service for image generation);
- 📫 How to reach me:
  - through Twitter ([@therenceferron](https://twitter.com/therenceferron)),
  - through Discord ([Thérence#9209](https://discord.com/users/177524193510948864)),
